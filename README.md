## About
2D town shooter created while following the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/.  However, I chose to architect my scripts differently, trying to use UnityEvents and write more generic, behaviour based scripts over the 1 script per gameobject style the tutorial uses.

## Credits
Assets were based on what was used in the Udemy tutorial:

The ship sprites and sound effects were from Kenney:
  -  https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux
  -  https://www.kenney.nl/assets/digital-audio

Music was from OpenGameArt:
  -  Through Space - maxstack (https://opengameart.org/content/through-space)
